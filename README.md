####TODO Items:
* Plain Text Import
* JSON Import
* ChordPro Export (Import currently working)
* SongPro Import/Export
* MediaShout Import/Export
* EasyWorship Import/Export
* Better way for converters to tell the UI they are done
* Can I use Zepto instead of jQuery? ProPresenter import needs the XML parsing.
