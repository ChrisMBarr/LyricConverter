<h4>SongShow Plus Notes</h4>
<p>The SongShow Plus files have has only been tested with <strong>version 7</strong>.</p>
<p>
  The majority of SongShow Plus files are formatted in a similar manner which this tool can read,
  but occasionally there are files with odd formatting. In these cases all the text
  <em>should</em> be extracted, but it cannot be organized in any way. All I can do in this case is
  dump all the text onto a single slide. You might have better luck converting these problem files
  to text format instead.
