        Eventually I would love for LyricConverter to convert between all of these formats and more,

<h4>SongShow Plus Notes</h4>
<p>
  SongShow Plus files are in a binary format, which can make them difficult to extract song lyrics
  from sometimes. The majority of SongShow Plus files are formatted in a similar manner which
  LyricConverter can read, but occasionally there are files with odd formatting. In these cases all
  the text <em>should</em> be extracted, but it cannot be organized in any way. All I can do in this
  case is dump all the text onto a single slide. You might have better luck exporting these problem
  files from SongShow Plus into other formats.
