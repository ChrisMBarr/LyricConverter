    <h4>Why Was This Made?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm the guy at my church who runs the lyric presentation software for a
      lot of the services. We used SongShow Plus for several years, and it
      worked pretty well for us. It did have a few key frustrations for us, plus
      the fact that we <em>really</em> wanted to switch over to a Mac. After
      looking into it, ProPresenter seemed like a great choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      After making the leap, we quickly realized that SongShow Plus had
      absolutely <strong>no way to export</strong> our songs, and ProPresenter
      had absolutely no way of getting these songs from SongShow Plus! Sure,
      there are a few half-baked solutions out there, or the good old
      copy-n-paste-every-slide-of-every-song method, but none of those are
      really ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking to the media director at another church, he told me that
      they were holding off making the same software switch that we had made
      because they were uncertain of how to transfer all of their songs over.
      This got me thinking&hellip; It seemed as if enough people had the need
      for a tool like this and yet one didn&#39;t exist!
    </p>

    <p>
      In my non-church time during the week I&#39;m a full time web
      designer/developer, so I decided to take a look at the file formats for
      each program and determined that it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to do!
      Well&hellip; There ended up being a bit more complexities than I
      anticipated, and it did take quite a while to get it to the point where I
      felt comfortable releasing it. <strong>BUT</strong>, here it is. I hope
      you find it useful.
