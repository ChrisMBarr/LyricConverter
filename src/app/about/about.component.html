        I'm the guy at my church who runs the lyric presentation software for a lot of the services.
        We used SongShow Plus for several years, and it worked pretty well for us. It did have a few
        key frustrations for us, plus the fact that we <em>really</em> wanted to switch over to a
        Mac. After looking into it, ProPresenter seemed like a great choice.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-2">
        After making the leap, we quickly realized that SongShow Plus had absolutely
        <strong>no way to export</strong> our songs, and ProPresenter had absolutely no way of
        getting these songs from SongShow Plus! Sure, there are a few half-baked solutions out
        there, or the good old copy-n-paste-every-slide-of-every-song method, but none of those are
        really ideal.

        After talking to the media director at another church, he told me that they were holding off
        making the same software switch that we had made because they were uncertain of how to
        transfer all of their songs over. This got me thinking&hellip; It seemed as if enough people
        had the need for a tool like this and yet one didn&#39;t exist!
      </p>

      <p>
        In my non-church time during the week I&#39;m a full time web designer/developer, so I
        decided to take a look at the file formats for each program and determined that it
        wouldn&#39;t be that hard to do! Well&hellip; There ended up being a bit more complexities
        than I anticipated, and it did take quite a while to get it to the point where I felt
        comfortable releasing it.
        <strong>BUT</strong>, here it is. I hope you find it useful.
