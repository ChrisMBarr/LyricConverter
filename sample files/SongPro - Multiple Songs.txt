Christians, awake, salute the happy morn
#1
Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,
Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born:
Rise to adore the mystery of love,
Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
With them the joyful tidings first begun
Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
#2
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
Who heard the angelic herald's voice: Behold,
I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
To you and all the nations upon earth:
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.
#3
He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire,
The praises of redeeming love they sang,
And heaven's whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
God's highest glory was their anthem still,
Peace upon earth, and unto men good-will.
#4
To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran,
To see the wonder God had wrought for man:
Then to their flocks, still praising God, return,
And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn;
Amazed, the wondrous tidings they proclaim,
The first apostles of His infant fame.
#5
O may we keep and ponder in our mind
God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,
From the poor manger to the bitter Cross;
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
#6
Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;
He that was born upon this joyful day
Around us all His glory shall display;
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.

For my sake and the Gospel's, go
#1
For my sake and the Gospel's, go
And tell Redemption's story;
His heralds answer, "Be it so,
And Thine, Lord, all the glory!
They preach His birth, His life, His cross,
The love of His atonement,
For whom they count the world but loss,
His Easter, His enthronement.
#2
Hark, hark, the trump of Jubilee
Proclaims to every nation,
From pole to pole, by land and sea,
Glad tidings of salvation:
As nearer draws the day of doom,
While still the battle rages,
The heavenly Dayspring, through the gloom
Breaks on the night of ages.
#3
Still on and on the anthems spread
Of Hallelujah voices,
In concert with the holy dead
The warrior-Church rejoices:
Their snow-white robes are washed in blood,
Their golden harps are ringing;
Earth, and the Paradise of God,
One triumph-song are singing.
#4
He comes, whose Advent Trumpet drowns
The last of Time's evangels
Emmanuel crowned with many crowns,
The Lord of saints and angels:
O Life, Light, Love, the great I am,
Triune, who changest never;
The throne of God and of the Lamb
Is Thine, and Thine for ever!

Hail to the Lord's Anointed
#1
Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free,
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.
#2
He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth,
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth:
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go:
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.
#3
Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
For He shall have dominion,
O'er river, sea and shore,
For as the eagle's pinion,
Or dove's light wing can soar.
#4
He comes with succour speedy
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
Their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
Were precious in His sight.
#5
O'er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest;
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blest:
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand for ever,
His changeless Name of Love.

Tell me the stories of Jesus
#1
Tell me the stories of Jesus
I love to hear;
Things I would ask him to tell me
If he were here;
Scenes by the wayside,
Tales of the sea,
Stories of Jesus,
Tell them to me.
#2
First let me hear how the children
Stood round his knee;
And I shall fancy his blessing
Resting on me;
Words full of kindness,
Deeds full of grace,
All in the love-light
Of Jesus' face.
#3
Tell me, in accents of wonder,
How rolled the sea,
Tossing the boat in a tempest
On Galilee;
And how the Master,
Ready and kind,
Chided the billows,
And hushed the wind.
#4
Into the city I'd follow
The children's band,
Waving a branch of the palm-tree
High in my hand;
One of his heralds,
Yes, I would sing
Loudest hosannas,
Jesus is King!
#5
Show me that scene in the garden,
Of bitter pain;
And of the cross where my Saviour
For me was slain;
And, through the sadness,
Help me to see
How Jesus suffered
For love of me.
#6
Tell me with joy of his rising
Up from the grave;
And how he still lives triumphant,
Ready to save.
Wonderful story,
Jesus my friend,
Living and loving
Right to the end.

Tell the world, the whole wide world;
Bear the news from shore to shore;
Tell the whole wide world of Jesus,
Praise His name for evermore!

Tell the whole wide world of Jesus,

Telling sinners of the Saviour,
Let the light spread more and more.

Send abroad the gospel heralds,
Let them take the blessed light
Into every land of darkness,
Piercing through the shades of night.
#3
Yes, we'll send the joyful message
Over mountain, over wave,
Telling everywhere of Jesus,
And His mighty power to save.
#4
While we pray for other nations,
Send them help with willing hand,
Let us not forget the home fields-
Jesus for our native land!

There's a calling to the nations (All over the world )
#C
All over the world we're singing,
All over the world there's praise
To the King of our salvation,
And the Author of our faith.
All over the world we're dancing,
All over the world there's joy,
We've called upon Your name
And we are saved!
#1
There's a calling to the nations
To make ready in Your name
To take up the yoke of Jesus
And proclaim the coming day.
There's a pouring of Your Spirit
As our old men dream Your dreams;
Prophesy through sons and daughters,
come envision us again.
#2
You're the Word and the Word is Truth,
You're the Promise that was born in You,
And a wave of expectation fills my soul!
#3
Can it be this generation
That will hear revival's song?
As your Spirit of creation
Comes awakening the lost.
Let the four winds blow Your justice,
Come and harvest of the earth;
Turn our mourning into dancing
As we herald Your return.
#4
You're the Word and the Word is Truth,
You're the Promise that was born in You,
And a wave of expectation fills my soul!

Thou art coming, O my Saviour,
Thou art coming, O my King,
In Thy beauty all-resplendent,
In Thy glory all-transcendent;
Well may we rejoice and sing.
Coming! In the opening east
Herald brightness slowly swells;
Coming! O my glorious Priest,
Hear we not Thy golden bells?
#2
Thou art coming, Thou art coming;
We shall meet Thee on Thy way,
We shall see Thee, we shall know Thee,
We shall bless Thee, we shall show
Thee All our hearts could never say.
What an anthem that will be,
Ringing out our love to Thee,
Pouring out our rapture sweet,
At Thine own all-glorious feet!
#3
O the joy to see Thee reigning,
Thee, my own beloved Lord!
Every tongue Thy Name confessing,
Worship, honour, glory, blessing,
Brought to Thee with glad accord
Thee, my Master and my Friend,
Vindicated and enthroned,
Unto earth's remotest end
Glorified, adored, and owned!

Thy Hand, O God Has Guided
#1
Thy hand, O God has guided
Thy flock, from age to age;
The wondrous tale is written,
Full clear on every page.
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;
And both of this bear witness:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
#2
Thy heralds brought glad tidings
To greatest as to least;
They bade them rise and hasten
To share the great King's feast.
And this was all their teaching
In every deed and word;
To all alike proclaiming:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
#3
Through many a day of darkness,
Through many a scene of strife,
The faithful few fought bravely
To guard the nation's life.
Their gospel of redemption,
Sin pardoned, man restored,
Was all in this enfolded:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
#4
Thy mercy will not fail us,
Nor leave Thy work undone;
With Thy right hand to help us,
The victory shall be won.
And then, by men and angels,
Thy name shall be adored,
And this shall be their anthem:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

To the work! to the work!
#C
Toiling on, toiling on,
toiling on, toiling on;
Let us hope and trust,
Let us watch and pray,
And labour till the Master comes.
#1
To the work! to the work! we are servants of God,
Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;
With the balm of His counsel our strength to renew,
Let us do with our might what our hands find to do.
#2
To the work! to the work! let the hungry be fed,
To the fountain of life let the weary be led!
In the Cross and its banner our glory shall be
While we herald the tidings, 'Salvation is free!'
#3
To the work! to the work! there is labour for all,
For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall:
And the Name of Jehovah exalted shall be
In the loud-swelling chorus, 'Salvation is free!'
#4
To the work! to the work! in the strength of the Lord,
And a robe and a crown shall our labour reward
When the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be
And we shout with the ransomed, 'Salvation is free!'
