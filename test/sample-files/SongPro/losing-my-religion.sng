| [F] | [F] [G] | [Am] | [G] |

# Verse 1

Oh, [Am]life is bigger
[Em] It's bigger than you, and you are [Am]not me
The lengths that I will [Em]go to, the distance in your [Am]eyes
[Em] Oh no, I've said too [Dm]much. I set it [G]up

# Verse 2

That's me in the [Am]corner
That's me in the [Em]spotlight, losing my re-[Am]ligion
Trying to [Em]keep up with you and I [Am]don't know if I can do it
[Em] Oh no, I've said too [Dm]much. I haven't said e-[G]nough

# Bridge 1

[G] I thought that I heard you [F]laughing
[F]I thought that I [G]heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw  [G]you [Am]try [G]

# Verse 3

Every [Am]whisper of every waking [Em]hour
I'm choosing my con-[Am]fessions
Trying to [Em]keep an eye on you
Like a [Am]hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
[Em] Oh no, I've said too [Dm]much. I set it [G]up

# Verse 4

Consider [Am]this, consider this
The [Em]hint of a century
Consider [Am]this: the slip
That [Em]brought me to my knees failed
[Am]What if all these fantasies come [Em] flailing around?
Now I've [Dm]said too [G]much

# Bridge 2

[G] I thought that I heard you [F]laughing
[F]I thought that I [G]heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw  [G]you [Am]try [G]

But [C]that was just a [Dm]dream
[C]That was just a [Dm]dream

# Verse 5

That's me in the [Am]corner
That's me in the [Em]spotlight losing my re-[Am]ligion
Trying to [Em]keep up with you and I [Am]don't know if I can do it
[Em] Oh no, I've said too [Dm]much, I haven't said e-[G]nough.

I [G]thought that I heard you [F]laughing,
I [F]thought that I [G]heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw [G]you [Am]try
But [F]that was just a [Dm]dream [G] [Am]Try, cry, why, try
[F]That was just a dream [G]just a [Am]dream just a [G]dream, dream.
