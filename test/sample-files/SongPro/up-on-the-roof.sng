# Intro

(Up on the [G]Roof)
(Up on the [G]Roof)

# Verse 1

[G]When this old world starts [Em]getting me down
And [C]people are just too [D]much for me to [G]face (up on the roof)
[G]I climb way up to the [Em]top of the stairs
And [C]all my cares just [D]drift right into [G]space (up on the roof)

# Chorus 1

[C]On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And [G]there the world be[Em]low can't bother [C]me [D]
Let me tell you now

# Verse 2

[G]When I come home feelin' [Em]tired and beat
I [C]go up where the [D]air is fresh and [G]sweet (up on the roof)
[G]I get away from the [Em]hustling crowd
And [C]all that rat-race [D]noise down in the [G]street (up on the roof)

# Chorus 2

[C]On the roof, the only place I know
Where [G]you just have to [Em]wish to make it [C]so [D]
Let's go up on the [G]roof (up on the roof)

# String Solo

| [G] | [Em] | [C] | [D] |
| [G] | [G] |

# Chorus 2

At [C]night the stars put on a show for free
And [G]darling you can [Em]share it all with [C]me [D]
I keep a-tellin' you

# Verse 3

[G]Right smack dab in the [Em]middle of town
I've [C]found a para-[D]dise that's trouble [G]proof (up on the roof)
And [G]if this world starts [Em]getting you down
There's [C]room enough for [D]two

# Outro

Up on the [G]roof (up on the roof)
Up on the [Em]roof (up on the roof)
Oh come on [G]baby (up on the roof)
Oh come on [Em]honey (up on the roof)
