# Verse 1

[Em]Breathe, breathe in the [A7]air
[Em]Don't be afraid to [A7]care
[Em]Leave, don't leave [A7]me
[Em]Look around and choose your [A7]own ground

# Chorus

[Bm7]Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
[FM7]All you touch and all you see
Is [G]all your life will [Dm7]ever be [Adim]

# Verse 2

[Em]Run, rabbit [A7]run
[Em]Dig that hole, forget the [A7]sun
[Em]And when at last the work is [A7]done
[Em]Don't sit down it's time to dig a-[A7]nother one.

# Chorus 2
[CM7]Long you live and high you fly
But [Bm7]only if you ride the tide
[FM7]Balanced on the biggest wave
[G]Race towards an [Dm7]early grave [Adim]

# Verse 3

[Em]Home, home a-[A7]gain
[Em]I like to be there when I [A7]can
[Em]When I come home cold and [A7]tired
It's [Em]good to warm my bones beside the [A7]fire

# Chorus 3

[CM7]Far away across the field
The [Bm7]tolling of the iron bell
[FM7]Calls the faithful to their knees
To [G]hear the softly [Dm7]spoken [Adim]magic [Bm]spells.
