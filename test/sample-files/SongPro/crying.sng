# Intro

| [D] | [D] |

# Verse 1

I was al-[D]right for a-[D]while
I could [D]smile for a-[D]while
But I [D]saw you last night
you held my [Daug]hand so tight
as you [G]stopped to say hel-[Gm]lo
Oh, you [D]wished me well, you [A]couldn't tell
[A7]that I'd been...

# Chorus 1

[D]Crying [F#m]over you
[D]Crying [F#m]over you
Then [G]you said so [A]long,
left me [G]standing all a-[A]lone
Alone and [D]crying, [Daug]crying, [G]crying, [Gm]crying
It's hard to [D]understand
but the [A]touch of your [A7]hand
can start me [D]crying

# Verse 2

I thought that [D]I was over [D]you
but it's [D]true, so [D]true
I love you [D]even more
than I [Daug]did before
But [G]darling, what can I [Gm]do?
Cause you [D]don't love me
and I'll [A]always [A7]be...

# Chorus 2

[D]Crying [F#m]over you
[D]Crying [F#m]over you
[G]Yes, now you're [A]gone
And [G]from this moment [A]on
I'll be [D]crying, [Daug]crying, [G]crying, [Gm]crying

# Ending

I'm [D]crying [D]
[D]cry-[Bm]ing
[G]Oh-oh-oh-[A7]over
[D]you [A7] [D] [G] [D] [D] [D] [D]
