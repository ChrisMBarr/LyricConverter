| [Dm] | [E7] | [Am] | [Am] |

# Verse 1

I'm just a [Am]poor
Wayfaring stranger
Travelling [Dm]through
This world be-[Am]low

There is no [Am]sickness
No toil, nor danger
In that bright [Dm]land
[E] To which I [Am]go

# Chorus

I'm going [F]there
To see my [C]father
And all my [F]loved ones
Who've gone [E]on [E7]
I'm just [Am]going over Jordan
I'm just [Dm]going [E] over [Am]home

# Verse 2

I know dark [Am]clouds
Will gather round me
I know my [Dm]way
Is hard and [Am]steep

But beauteous [Am]fields
Arise before me
Where God's re-[Dm]deemed
[E]Their vigils [Am]keep

# Chorus

I'm going [F]there
To see my [C]father
And all my [F]loved ones
Who've gone [E]on [E7]
So I'm just [Am]going over Jordan
I'm just [Dm]going [E] over [Am]home
I'm just [Am]going over Jordan
I'm just [Dm]going [E] over [Am]home
