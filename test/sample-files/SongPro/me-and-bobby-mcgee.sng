# Verse 1

[G]Busted flat in Baton Rouge waitin' for a train
Feelin' nearly faded as my [D]jeans
[D]Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
[D7]Rode us all the way to New Or-[G]leans [C] [G]
I [G]pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was [G7]playin' soft while Bobby sang the [C]blues
[C]Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was [G]holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
[D]We sang every song that driver [D7]knew

# Chorus 1

[C]Freedom's just another word for [G]nothin' left to lose,
[D]Nothin' don't mean [D7]nothin' if it ain't [G7]free.
[C]Feelin' good was easy, Lord, [G]when he sang the blues.
[D]Feelin' good was good enough for me
[D7]Good enough for me and Bobby Mc-[G]Gee

# Verse 2

From the [A]Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,
Bobby shared the secrets of my [E]soul.
Through [E]all kinds of weather, through everything we done,
Hey, [E7]Bobby's body kept me from the [A]cold [D] [A]
One [A]day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,
He's [A7]lookin' for that home and I hope he [D]finds it.
But I'd [D]trade all my tomorrows for one [A]single yesterday,
To be [E]holdin' Bobby's body next to [E7]mine

# Chorus 2

[D]Freedom's just another word for [A]nothin' left to lose
[E]Nothin', that's [E7]all that Bobby left [A]me, yeah
But [D]feelin' good was easy, Lord, [A]when he sang the blues
Hey [E]feelin' good was good enough for [E7]me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby Mc-[A]Gee

# Verse 3

[A]La da da...
Bobby Mc-[E]Gee, yeah
La da da da da da da...
Bobby Mc-[A]Gee, yeah

[A]La da La la da...
Hey, my Bobby, Oh, my Bobby Mc-[E]Gee, yeah
La la la la...
Hey, my Bobby Oh, my Bobby Mc-[A]Gee, yeah

# Bridge

Well, [A]I call him my lover, call him my man
I said, I call him my lover did the best I can, c'mon
Hey now, Bobby now
Hey now, Bobby Mc-[E]Gee, yeah
Woo
La da, [E7]la da, la da, la da, la da, la da, la da, la la
Hey, hey, hey Bobby Mc-[A]Gee, yeah
