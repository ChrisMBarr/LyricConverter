# Intro

| [E] | [E] | [E] | [E] |

# Verse 1

[E]Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his [A]daddy would visit he'd [E]come along
When they'd gather 'round and started talking
[B]That's when Billy would take me walking
A-through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
[B7]Lord knows to my surprise

# Chorus

The [E]only one who could ever reach me
[A] Was the son of a [E]preacher man
The [E]only boy who could ever teach me
[A] Was the son of a [E]preacher man
Yes he [E]was, he [B]was, [A] mmm, yes he was

# Instrumental

# Verse 2 

[E]Being good isn't always easy
[A]No matter how hard I'd [E]try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
[B]He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
[B7]Can I get away again tonight

# Chorus

The [E]only one who could ever reach me
[A] Was the son of a [E]preacher man
The [E]only boy who could ever teach me
[A] Was the son of a [E]preacher man
Yes he [E]was, he [B]was, [A] mmm, yes he was

# Bridge

Yes, he [D]was
[D] How well I remember
[A] The look was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
[B] Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
[E] Learnin' from each other's knowin'
[E7]Look at us here, how much we've grown

# Chorus

And the [A]only one who could ever reach me
[D] Was the son of a [A]preacher man
The [A]only boy who could ever teach me
[D] Was the son of a [A]preacher man
Yes he [A]was, he [E]was, [D7]ooh yes he was

# Outro

And the [A]only one who could ever reach me
[D] Was the son of a [A]preacher man
And the [A]only one who could ever reach me
[D] Was the son of a [A]preacher man
