# Verse 1

[Bm]Hello?
Is there anybody [A]in there?
Just nod if you can [G]hear me[D/F#] [Em]
Is there [Bm]anyone at home?
[Bm]Come on, now
I hear you're [A]feeling down
[G]I can ease [D/F#]your [Em]pain
And get you [Bm]on your feet again
[Bm]Relax
I'll need some infor-[A]mation first
[G]Just the basic [D/F#] facts [Em]
Can you [Bm]show me where it hurts?

# Chorus

[D]There is no pain you are re-[A]ceding
[D]A distant ship smoke on the ho-[A]rizon
[G/B] [C]You are only coming through in [G]waves
[G/B] Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're [G]saying

When [D]I was a child I had a [A]fever
My [D]hands felt just like two bal-[A]loons
[G/B] [C]Now I've got that feeling once a-[G]gain, I can't explain,
You would [G/B]not [C]understand, This is not how I [G]am

[A]I [G/B] [Cadd9] have be-[G]come comfortably [D]numb.

| [C] | [G] | [C] | [G] |
[A]I [G/B] [Cadd9] have be-[G]come comfortably [D]numb.

# Verse 2

[Bm]O.K.
Just a little [A]pinprick
There'll be no more [G]aaa-[D/F#]aaa-[Em]aaah!
But you may [Bm]feel a little sick
Can you [Bm]stand up?
I do believe it's [A]working, good
That'll keep you [G]going through [D/F#]the [Em]show
Come [Bm]on it's time to go.

# Chorus

[D]There is no pain, you are re-[A]ceding
[D]A distant ship smoke on the ho-[A]rizon
[G/B] [C]You are only coming through in [G]waves
[G/B] Your [C]lips move but I can't hear what you're [G]saying

When [D]I was a child, I caught a [A]fleeting glimpse
[D]Out of the corner of my [A]eye
[G/B] [C]I turned to look but it was [G]gone
I cannot put my fin[G/B]ger [C]on it now
The child is grown, The [G]dream is gone

[A]I [G/B] [Cadd9] have be-[G]come comfortably [D]numb. [D]
