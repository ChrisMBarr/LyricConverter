# Verse 1

There are [A]places [E]I'll re-[F#m]member [A7/G]
All my [D]li-[Dm]fe though [A]some have changed
Some for-[A]ever [E]not for [F#m]better [A7/G]
Some have [D]go-[Dm]ne and [A]some remain

# Bridge 1

All these [F#m]places have their [D]moments
With [G]lovers and friends I [A]still can recall
Some are [F#m]dead and some are [B]living
In [Dm7]my life I've [A]loved them all

# Verse 2

But of [A]all these [E]friends and [F#m]lovers [A7/G]
There is [D]no [Dm]one com-[A]pares with you
And these [A]memories [E]lose their [F#m]meaning [A7/G]
When I [D]think of [Dm]love as [A]something new

# Bridge 2

Though I [F#m]know I'll never lose af-[D]fection
For [G]people and things that [A]went before
I [F#m]know I'll often stop and think a-[B]bout them
In [Dm7]my life I [A]love you more

Though I [F#m]know I'll never lose af-[D]fection
For [G]people and things that [A]went before

In [Dm7]my life I [A]love you more
