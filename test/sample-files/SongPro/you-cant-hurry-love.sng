# Verse 1

I need [A]love, love to [D]ease my mind [A]
I need to [C#m]find, [F#m]find someone to [Bm]call mine
But [E]mama said

# Chorus 1

You [A]can't hurry love, No you [D]just have to [A]wait
She said [C#m]love don't come [F#m]easy, [Bm]It's a game of [E]give and take

You [A]can't hurry love, No, you [D]just have to [A]wait
You gotta [C#m]trust, [F#m]give it time, No [Bm]matter how [E]long it takes

# Bridge 1

But [C#m]how many heartaches must I stand
Before I [F#m]find a love to let me live again
Right now the [D]only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I [E]feel my strength, yeah, it's [E7]almost gone
I remember mama said

# Chorus 2

You [A]can't hurry love, No you [D]just have to [A]wait
She said [C#m]love don't come [F#m]easy, [Bm]It's a game of [E]give and take

How [A]long must I wait, How much [D]more can I [A]take
Before [C#m]loneli-[F#m]ness will [Bm]'cause my heart, [E]heart to break?

# Bridge 2

No, [C#m]I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow im-[F#m]patient for a love to call my own
But when I [D]feel that I, I can't go on
These [E]precious words keeps me [E7]hanging on
I remember mama said

# Chorus 3

You [A]can't hurry love, No you [D]just have to [A]wait
She said [C#m]love don't come [F#m]easy, [Bm]It's a game of [E]give and take

You [A]can't hurry love, No you [D]just have to [A]wait
She said [C#m]trust, [F#m]give it time, No [Bm]matter how [E7]long it takes
Now [A]break [A]

# Verse 2

No [A]love, love don't come [D]easy [A]
But I [C#m]keep on [F#m]waiting
An-[Bm]tici-[E]pating for that
[A]Soft voice to talk to [D]me at night[A]
For some [C#m]tender [F#m]arms
To [Bm]hold me [E]tight

I keep [A]waiting, I keep on [D]waiting [A]
But it ain't [C#m]easy [F#m]
it ain't [Bm]easy when [E]mama said

# Chorus 4

You [A]can't hurry love, No, you [D]just have to [A]wait
You gotta [C#m]trust, [F#m]give it time, No [Bm]matter how [E]long it takes

You [A]can't hurry love, No you [D]just have to [A]wait
She said [C#m]love don't come [F#m]easy, [Bm]It's a game of [E]give and take
