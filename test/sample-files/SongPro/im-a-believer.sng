# Verse 1

[G]I thought love was [D]only true in [G]fairy tales

Then I saw her [G]face [C] [G]
now [C]Im a bel-[G]iever [C] [G]

of [C]doubt in my [G]mind [C] [G]
[C]I'm in [G]love [C]ooh
I'm a be-[G]liever! I couldn't [F]leave her if I [D]tried

# Verse 2

[G]I thought love was [D]more or less a [G]given thing
[G]Seems the more I [D]gave the less I [G]got
