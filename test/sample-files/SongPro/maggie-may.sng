# Verse 1

[A]Wake up Maggie I [G]think I've got something to [D]say to you
It's [A]late September and I [G]really should be [D]back at school
I [G]know I keep you [D]amused But I [G]feel I'm being [A]used

Oh [Em]Maggie I couldn't have [F#m]tried any [Em]more [Asus4] [A]
You [Em]led me away from [A]home just to [Em]save you from being a-[A]lone
You [Em]stole my heart, and [A]that's what really [D]hurts

# Verse 2

The [A]morning sun when it's [G]in your face really [D]shows your age
But [A]that don't worry me [G]none, in my eyes you're [D]everything
I [G]laughed at all your [D]jokes, my [G]love you didn't need to [A]coax
Oh [Em]Maggie I couldn't have [F#m]tried any [Em]more [Asus4] [A]
You led [Em]me away from [A]home just to [Em]save you from being a-[A]lone
You [Em]stole my soul that's a [A]pain I can do with-[D]out

# Verse 3

[A]All I needed was a [G]friend to lend a [D]guiding hand
But you [A]turned into a lover and [G]mother what a lover you [D]wore me out
[G]All you did was wreck my [D]bed, and in the [G]morning kick me in the [A]head
Oh [Em]Maggie I couldn't have [F#m]tried any [Em]more [Asus4] [A]
You [Em]led me away from [A]home 'cause you [Em]didn't want to be a-[A]lone
You [Em]stole my heart I couldn't [A]leave you if I [D]tried

# Verse 4

I [A]suppose I should [G]collect my books and get [D]back to school
Or [A]steal my daddy's [G]cue make a living out of [D]playing pool
Or [G]find myself a rock and roll [D]band that [G]needs a helping [A]hand
Oh [Em]Maggie, I wish I'd [F#m]never seen your [Em]face [Asus4] [A]
You made a [Em]first class fool out of [A]me, but I'm as [Em]blind as a fool can [A]be
You [Em]stole my heart but I [A]love you any-[D]way
