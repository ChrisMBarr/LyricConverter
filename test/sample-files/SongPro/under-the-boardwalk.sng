Oh, when the [G]sun beats down and burns the tar up on the [D]roof

Under the [C]boardwalk, down by the [G]sea, yeah
On a [G]blanket with my baby [D] is where I'll [G]be

(Under the [Em]boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the [D]boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun

(Under the [D]boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the [Em]board-[Em]walk ([Em]board-[Em]walk!)

# Verse 2

From the [G]park you hear the happy sound of a carou-[D]sel
Mm-mm, [D]you can almost taste the hot dogs and French fries they [G]sell
Under the [C]boardwalk, down by the [G]sea, yeah
On a [G]blanket with my baby[D] is where I'll [G]be
