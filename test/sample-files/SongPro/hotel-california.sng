# Verse 1

[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]Warm smell of colitas, [E]rising up through the air
[G]Up ahead in the distance, I [D]saw a shimmering light
[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, [F#]I had to stop for the night

# Verse 2

[Bm]There she stood in the doorway; [F#]I heard the mission bell
[A]And I was thinking to myself, this could be [E]heaven or this could be hell
[G]Then she lit up a candle and she [D]showed me the way
[Em]There were voices down the corridor, [F#]I thought I heard them say...

# Chorus 1

[G]Welcome to the hotel Cali-[D]fornia;
Such a [F#]lovely place, such a [Bm]lovely face
[G]Plenty of room at the hotel Cali-[D]fornia,
any [Em]time of year, you can [F#]find it here

# Verse 3

[Bm]Her mind is tiffany-twisted, [F#]she got the Mercedes Benz
[A]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that [E]she calls friends
[G]How they dance in the courtyard, [D]sweet summer sweat.
[Em]Some dance to remember, [F#]some dance to forget

# Verse 4

[Bm]So I called up the captain, [F#]please bring me my wine
He said, we [A]haven t had that spirit here since [E]nineteen sixty nine
[G]And still those voices are calling from [D]far away
[Em]Wake you up in the middle of the night, [F#]just to hear them say

# Chorus 2

[G]Welcome to the hotel Cali-[D]fornia;
Such a [F#]lovely place, such a [Bm]lovely face
[G]They re living it up at the hotel Cali-[D]fornia
What a [Em]nice surprise, bring your [F#]alibis

# Verse 5

[Bm]Mirrors on the ceiling, [F#]the pink champagne on ice
And she said [A]we are all just prisoners here, [E]of our own device
[G]And in the master s chambers, [D]they gathered for the feast
[Em]The stab it with their steely knives, but they [F#]just can t kill the beast

# Verse 6

[Bm]Last thing I remember, I was [F#]running for the door
[A]I had to find the passage back, to the [E]place I was before
[G]relax, said the night man, we are [D]programmed to receive.
[Em]You can checkout any time you like, [F#]but you can never leave!
