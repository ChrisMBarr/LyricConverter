# Intro

| [D] | [D] | [D] | [D] |

# Verse 1

[D]Well I don't know why I came here tonight
[D]I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm [D]wondering how I'll get down the stairs

# Chorus 1

[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]Jokers to the [G]right, here I am
[D]Stuck in the middle with you

# Verse 2

[D]Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you
[D]And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so [G7]hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing con[D]trol, yeah, I'm all over the place

# Chorus 2

[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]Jokers to the [G]right, here I am
[D]Stuck in the middle with you

# Bridge 1

Well you [G7]started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self made man [D]
And your [G7]friends, they all come crawlin', slap you on the back and say
[D]Please.... [Am7]Please.....

# Slide Guitar 1

# Verse 3

[D]Trying to make some sense of it all
[D]But I can see that it makes no sense at all
Is it [G7]cool to go to sleep on the floor
'Cause I don't [D]think that I can take anymore

# Chorus 3

[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]Jokers to the [G]right, here I am
[D]Stuck in the middle with you
