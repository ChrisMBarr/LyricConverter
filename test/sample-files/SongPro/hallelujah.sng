# Intro

| [C] | [Am] | [C] | [Am] |

# Verse 1

I [C]heard there was a [Am]secret chord
That [C]David played and it [Am]pleased the lord
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you?  [G]
Well it [C]goes like this the [F]fourth, the [G]fifth
The [Am]minor fall and the [F]major lift
The [G]baffled king [E7]composing halle-[Am]lujah

# Chorus 1

Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-jah
| [C] | [Am] | [C] | [Am] |

# Verse 2

Well your [C]faith was strong but you [Am]needed proof
You [C]saw her bathing [Am]on the roof
Her [F]beauty and the [G]moonlight over[C]threw you    [G]
[C]She tied you to her [F]kitchen [G]chair
She [Am]broke your throne and she [F]cut your hair
And [G]from your lips she [E7]drew the halle-[Am]lujah

# Chorus 2

Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-jah
| [C] | [Am] | [C] | [Am] |

# Verse 3

Well [C]Baby I've been [Am]here before
I've [C]seen this room and I've [Am]walked this floor
I [F]used to live a[G]lone before I [C]knew you   [G]
[C]I've seen your flag on the [F]marble [G]arch
But [Am]love is not a victory [F]march
It's a [G]cold and it's a [E7]broken halle-[Am]lujah

# Chorus 3

Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-jah
| [C] | [Am] | [C] | [Am] |

# Verse 4

Well [C]there was a time when you [Am]let me know
What's [C]really going [Am]on below
But [F]now you never [G]show that to me [C]do you   [G]
But re[C]member when I [F]moved in [G]you
And the [Am]holy dove was [F]moving too
And [G]every breath we [E7]drew was halle-[Am]lujah

# Chorus 4

Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-jah
| [C] | [Am] | [C] | [Am] |

# Verse 5

Well, [C]maybe there's a [Am]god above
But [C]all I've ever [Am]learned from love
Was [F]how to shoot some[G]body who out[C]drew you [G]
[G]
It's [C]not a cry that you [F]hear at [G]night
It's [Am]not somebody who's [F]seen the light
It's a [G]cold and it's a [E7]broken halle-[Am]lujah

# Chorus 5
Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-
Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-
Halle-[F]lujah, halle-[Am]lujah, halle-[F]lujah, halle-[C]lu-u-[G]u-u-[C]jah
