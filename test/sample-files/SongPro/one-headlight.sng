# Intro

| [G] | [D] | [F#] | [Bm] [D/A] |
| [G] | [D] | [F#] | [Bm] [D/A] |

# Verse 1

[G]So long ago, I don't re-[D]member when
That's [F#]when they say I lost my only [Bm]friend [D/A]
Well [G]they said she died easy of a [D]broken heart disease
As I [F#]listened through the cemetery [Bm]trees [D/A]

| [G] | [D] | [F#] | [Bm] [D/A] |

# Verse 2

I seen the [G]sun comin' up at the [D]funeral at dawn
The [F#]long broken arm of human [Bm]law [D/A]
Now it [G]always seemed such a waste, she [D]always had a pretty face
So I [F#]wondered how  she hung around this [Bm]place [D/A]

| [G] | [G] | [F#] | [F#] |

# Chorus 1

Hey, [G]come on try a little, [D]Nothing is forever
[Em]There's got to be something [A]better than in the middle
[G]But me and Cinderella [D] We put it all together
[Em] We can drive it home [A] With one head-[G]light [D] [F#] [Bm] [D/A]

# Verse 3

She said it's [G]cold, It feels like Inde-[D]pendence Day
And I [F#]can't break away from this pa-[Bm]rade [D/A]
But there's [G]got to be an opening, [D]Somewhere here in front of me
[F#]Through this maze of ugliness and [Bm]greed [D/A]

# Verse 4

And I seen the [G]sun up ahead at the [D]county line bridge
Sayin' [F#]all there's good and nothingness is [Bm]dead
We'll [G]run until she's out of breath, She [D]ran until there's nothin' left
She [F#]hit the end, it's just her window [Bm]ledge [D/A]

| [G] | [G] | [F#] | [F#] |

# Chorus 2

Hey, [G]come on try a little, [D]Nothing is forever
[Em]There's got to be something [A]better than in the middle
[G]But me and Cinderella [D] We put it all together
[Em] We can drive it home [A] With one headlight...

# Solo

| [G] | [D] | [F#] | [Bm] [D/A] |

# Verse 5

Well this place is [G]old, It feels just like a [D]beat up truck
I turn the [F#]engine, but the engine doesn't [Bm]turn [D/A]
Well it smells of [G]cheap wine, cigarettes, This [D]place is always such a mess
Some-[F#]times I think I'd like to watch it [Bm]burn [D/A]

# Verse 6

I'm so a-[G]lone and I feel just like some-[D]body else
Man, I ain't [F#]changed, but I know I ain't the [Bm]same [D/A]
But [G]somewhere here in between the [D]city walls of dyin' dreams
I [F#]think of death, it must be killin' [Bm]me [D/A]

| [G] | [G] | [F#] | [F#] |

# Chorus 3

Hey, hey Hey, [G]come on try a little, [D]Nothing is forever
[Em]There's got to be something [A]better than in the middle
[G]But me and Cinderella [D] We put it all together
[Em] We can drive it home [A] With one headlight...
