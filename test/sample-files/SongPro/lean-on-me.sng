# Verse 1

[C]Sometimes in our [F]lives

We all have [Em]sor-[G]row
[C]But if we are [F]wise
We know that [C]there's always [G]tomor-[C]row

[C]Lean on me, when you're not [F]strong
And I'll be your [C]friend, I'll help you [Em]carry [G]on
[C]For it won't be [F]long
'Til I'm gonna [C]need somebody to [G]lean [C]on

# Verse 2
[C]Please swallow your [F]pride
If I have [C]things
you need to [Em]bor-[G]row
[C]For no one can [F]fill
those of your [C]needs
That you don't [G]let [C]show

# Chorus 2

[C]Lean on me, when you're not [F]strong

[C]If there is a [F]load
you have to [C]bear

[C]I'm right up the [F]road
I'll share your [C]load
If you just [G]call [C]me

# Bridge

[C]So just call on me brother, when you [G]need a [C]hand
[C]We all need somebody to [G]lean [C]on
[C]I just might have a problem that [G]you'd under[C]stand
[C]We all need somebody to [G]lean [C]on
