[C] Ground Control to Major [Em]Tom
[C] Ground Control to Major [Em]Tom
[Am] Take your [Am/G]protein pills and [D/F#]put your helmet on

[C] This is Ground Control to Major [E]Tom

Now it's [Fm]time to leave the [C]capsule if you [F]dare

# Chorus 2

[C] This is Major Tom to Ground Con-[E]trol
I'm stepping through the [F]door
And I'm [Fm]floating in a [C]most peculiar [F]way
And the [Fm]stars look very [C]different [F]today

And there's [G]nothing I can [F] do

[C]Though I'm past one hundred thousand [E]miles

Tell my [Fm]wife I love her [C]very much she [F]knows

[G]Ground Control to [G#dim]Major Tom
[Am]Your circuit's dead, there's [Am/G]something wrong

Can you [G]hear me, Major Tom?
Can you...
