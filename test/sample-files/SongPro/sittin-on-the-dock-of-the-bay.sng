| [G] | [G] | [G] | [G] |

# Verse 1

[G]Sittin' in the mornin' [B]sun
I'll be [C]sittin' when the evenin' [A]comes
[G]Watching the ships roll [B]in
And then I [C]watch 'em roll away a-[A]gain, yeah

# Chorus 1

I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [E]bay
Watching the [G]tide roll a-[E]way
Ooo, I'm just [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
Wastin' [G]time [E]

# Verse 2

I [G]left my home in [B]Georgia
[C]Headed for the 'Frisco [A]Bay
[G]'Cause I've had nothing to [B]live for
And look like [C]nothin's gonna come my [A]way

# Chorus 2

So I'm just gonna [G]sit on the dock of the [E]bay
Watching the [G]tide roll a[E]way
Ooo, I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
Wastin' [G]time [E]

# Bridge

[G]Looks [D]like, [C]nothing's gonna change
[G] [D]Everything [C]still remains the same
[G]I can't [D]do what [C]ten people [G]tell me to do
[F]So I guess I'll re-[D]main the same, yes

# Verse 3

[G]Sittin' here resting my [B]bones
And this [C]loneliness won't leave me a-[A]lone
It's [G]two thousand miles I [B]roamed
Just to [C]make this dock my [A]home

# Chorus 3

Now I'm just gonna [G]sit on the dock of the [E]bay
Watching the [G]tide roll a-[E]way
Ooo, I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
Wastin' [G]time [E]
