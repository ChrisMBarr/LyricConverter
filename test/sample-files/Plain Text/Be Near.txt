Verse 1 (1):
You are all
Big and small
Beautiful

Verse 1 (2):
And wonderful to 
Trust in grace
Through faith
But I'm asking to taste

Bridge 1:
For dark is light to You
Depths are Height to you
Far is near
But Lord I need to hear from You

Chorus:
Be near O God
Be near O God of us
Your nearness is
To us our good

Post-Chorus:
Our Good

Verse 2 (1):
Your fullness is mine
Revelation Divine

Verse 2 (2):
But oh to taste
To know much
More than a page
To feel Your embrace

Ending:
My Good
