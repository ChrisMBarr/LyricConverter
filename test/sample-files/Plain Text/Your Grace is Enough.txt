Chorus:
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me

Verse 1:
Great is your faithfulness O God
You wrestle with the sinners heart
You lead us by still waters and to mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

Verse 2:
Great is your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of your salvation
And all your people sing along
